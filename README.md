# Computer_charge_room
This project combines C++ and data structure to design a computer room charging management system.

Main functional design:
(1) Input function: Enter the student ID, class, name, and computer start time of 30 students.
(2) Calculation function: Calculate the cost of getting on the computer for each student who gets off the computer, which is 1 yuan per hour.
(Boarding fee = boarding time * 1.0/h, less than one hour will be calculated as one hour)
(3) Query function: Display studentsâ€™ computer time based on conditions (class, student number, name).
(4) Display of machine usage.
